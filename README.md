# Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page

[Design preview for the Ping coming soon page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is a Ping coming soon page challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) I styled this using Sass and used JavaScript for form validation.

## Shoutout to Frontend Mentor and their Community Sponsors

- [Contrast](https://bit.ly/fem-contrast) reimagines how developers inspect, collaborate, and build components off Figma designs.
- [Diversify Tech](https://bit.ly/fem-diversify-tech) is an amazing resource for underrepresented people in tech. The site features job listings for anyone seeking new opportunities. The resource section is also full of useful links to dive into!
- [Triplebyte](http://bit.ly/fem-triplebyte) can save a lot of time and stress during the job hunting process. Their free, confidential quiz makes it so that companies end up pitching you for their vacant job roles.
